This is a web restourant buissiness based software with the idea to make the work process in restaurants much easier and smoother.
The web application is written on ASP.NET Core 2.2 with Razor Pages, following the MVC pattern. For data storage MSSQL local database is being used which is being accessed
via Entity Framework Core. In the database the main idea is to have Entity hierarchy having the User class entity containg all the information in the platform entries 
beneath. User entities have table entities data that have been served by them, and the tables themselves contain information about the orders, total sum and products that 
were ordered in the time period that they were active. To achieve that hierarchy the database has two One-To-Many relations between the entities. These relations are 
between  Tables and Orders, one Table has many Orders and one Order can have just one Table. Relativly the same is with Orders having multiple Products at once and the 
Product that can have just one order to be in.
For the back-end of the login, register and logout functionality and folder structure has been used Scaffolded Identity from ASP.NET Core.
The architecture of the Models, Views and Controllers has been used in Areas, each containing only the files that it's dependant on.
